<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I am Feiyang Hao (ÈÉùÈ£ûÊ¥ã), currently a third year undergraduate student studying software engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University.

My research interests lie in multimodal models and human-ai interaction.

"Stay hungry, stay foolish." I have hunger for adventure, and I think learning is a journey of a lifetime.

# üîç Research Experience
- Open-ended Financial Competency Assessment
  - Motivations: 
    - Compared to multiple-choice questions, open-ended questions can more authentically and comprehensively reflect the test-takers' proficiency and capabilities.
    - Open-ended questions pose significant challenges in terms of evaluation efficiency and fairness.
    - Financial capability assessment is essential not only for the recruitment of relevant fields, but also for the evaluation of customers' capabilities regarding financial products.
  - Task: Analyze the financial competency of respondents based on their answers to open-ended questions.
  - Ideas:
    - Collect and design representative open-ended questions based on professional knowledge in the financial domain.
    - Evaluate multiple assessment dimensions (financial knowledge, financial behavior, financial consciousness) involved in each sub-question based on Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS).
    - Design prompts using prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in-context learning (ICL), and role-playing to guide LLMs in generating high-quality datasets.
    - Fine-tune the model using active learning and other strategies.
  - Complete dataset generation and participate in literature investigation.
- An Evaluation System of Survey Result Credibility
  - Motivations:
  	- Evaluating the credibility of survey findings is crucial for research in fields such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
    - Existing methods fall short in assessing the credibility of results from open-ended questionnaires.
  - Task: Evaluate the validity and credibility of survey result data.
  - Ideas: 
    - Break down into four stages including prompt refining, answer generation, answer analysis and credibility assessment. 
    - Assign multiple LLMs of different capabilities and roles to solve sub-problems in each phase.  
    - Integrates the ideas demands of non-technical researchers with the processing procedures of LLMs.
    - Design an intuitive UI to enhance its usability for non-technical researchers.
  - Participate in dataset generation, UI design, and ablation studies.
- Calligraphy Layout Generative Model
  - Motivations:
    - The diverse and flexible layout is one of the major charms of Chinese calligraphy, and the generation of single-character layout is crucial for the overall generation of a calligraphic work. 
    - Using prompt engineering to generate layouts with large language models (LLMs) proved to be less effective and very costly.
  - Task: Generate high-quality layouts for calligraphy generation efficiently.
  - Ideas: 
    - Collected and annotated calligraphy image datasets.
    - Selected base models based on data distribution, performance, and computational efficiency.
    - Fine-tuned multiple models using LoRA, q-LoRA, and compared their performance through visualization.
  - Independently conducted model fine-tuning and visualization. 
- CalliReader: Contextualizing Chinese Calligraphy via an Embedding-Aligned Vision-Language Model   			PKU
  - A versatile vision-language model for Chinese calligraphy contextualization.
  - Model Capability: Full-page/region-wise recognition, multilingual interpretation, and intent analysis.
  - Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and OCR methods struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in recognizing Chinese calligraphy and conducting contextual reasoning.
  - Ideas: 
    - Character-wise Slicing: Simplify the recognition task while preserving character semantics.
    - CalliAlign Module: Compress visual tokens and align them with normalized text embeddings.
    - Embedding Instruction Tuning (e-IT): address data scarcity and improve interpretation ability.
    - CalliBench: The first comprehensive benchmark for full-page calligraphic contextualization.
  - Participate in literature investigation, benchmark construction, experiments, and paper writing.

    - Use multiple threads with thread pool to accelerate the calculation of feed forward and attention.
    - Synchronize between different threads using system signal, conditional variables, and semaphores.
    - Analyze the efficiency results with different number of threads and under different scheduling policies.
- PokeFusionLab: Fine-tune a Diffusion Model with Various Datasets, Co-Leader
  - Objective: Customize latent diffusion models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to generate images in specific styles and evaluate the impact of different training strategies.
  - Tasks:
    - Fine-tune a diffusion model on a single image to generate stylistically similar images by varying initial Gaussian noise and scaling factors of LoRA matrices.
    - Fine-tune a latent diffusion model on a dataset of Pok√©mon images with bilingual captions (English and Chinese) to compare the effects of language prompts on image generation.
    - Utilized visual-language models (Qwen2-VL-7b) to re-annotate an image-text dataset with varying levels of detail (brief, middle-brief, detailed captions) and fine-tuned diffusion models using these synthetic texts.
    - Conducted experiments to analyze the impact of detailed annotations on text-to-image generation tasks, showing that more descriptive captions may improve model performance.
