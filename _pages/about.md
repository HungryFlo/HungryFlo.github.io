<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I am Feiyang Hao (ÈÉùÈ£ûÊ¥ã), currently a third year undergraduate student studying software engineering in Xi'an Jiaotong University.

My research interests lie in multimodal models and human-ai interaction.

"Stay hungry, stay foolish." I have hunger for adventure, and I think learning is a journey of a lifetime.

Yuxuan Luo, Jiaqi Tang, Chenyi Huang, **Feiyang Hao**, Zhouhui Lian

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- **Task:** Create a versatile VLM for Chinese calligraphy contextualization ($CC^2$), including full-page/region-wise recognition, multilingual interpretation, and intent analysis.  
- **Ideas:** Proposed character-wise slicing to simplify recognition, introduced the CalliAlign module for embedding alignment, developed Embedding Instruction Tuning (e-IT) to enhance interpretation, and created CalliBench ‚Äî the first comprehensive benchmark for full-page calligraphic contextualization.  
- **Job:** Conducted a literature review of OCR methods and reasoning benchmarks for VLMs, performed comparisons between our model, state-of-the-art (SOTA) OCR methods, and other competitive VLMs, and participated in benchmark construction, model fine-tuning, ablation study, and paper writing.
